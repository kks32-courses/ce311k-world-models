    "Austin experienced one of the most dramatic traffic changes in its history during the 2020 pandemic - but not in the way you might expect. While most assumed traffic simply disappeared during lockdowns, the data reveals a more complex story: certain types of incidents actually increased, traffic patterns shifted to different times of day, and some areas became more dangerous while others became safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission:** Investigate this counterintuitive phenomenon using real Austin traffic incident data from the City of Austin's Open Data portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Big Question:** If everyone was staying home, why didn't traffic incidents simply disappear? What does this tell us about Austin's transportation resilience?\n",
